## 🌎 Problems & Solutions

### 🇩🇿 Algeria: Waste Contamination Crisis
**Problem:**  
Unregulated waste disposal in Algeria has led to serious air, soil, and water pollution. Overflowing landfills and open dumping near residential areas contribute to health risks and environmental damage.

**AI-Based Solution:**  
- AI-powered image recognition to detect illegal dumping sites  
- Machine learning for optimizing garbage collection routes  
- Mobile app with real-time sorting guidance and citizen rewards system

### 🇪🇬 Egypt: Traffic Congestion in Cairo
**Problem:**  
Cairo experiences extreme traffic congestion due to outdated infrastructure and traffic mismanagement. This contributes to high levels of air pollution and lost productivity.

**AI-Based Solution:**  
- Real-time traffic prediction models using machine learning  
- Smart traffic lights that adapt based on congestion levels  
- AI-based public transport route optimization

### 🇺🇸 United States (California): Wildfires
**Problem:**  
California faces increasingly severe wildfires due to climate change and poor land management. These fires result in massive environmental and economic damage.

**AI-Based Solution:**  
- AI-based satellite monitoring to predict wildfire risks  
- Drones using computer vision to detect early signs of fires  
- ML models trained on historical data for faster emergency response
